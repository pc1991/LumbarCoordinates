# LumbarCoordinates
Lumbar Coordinate Dataset

About Dataset
This dataset was put together as a pretraining objective for the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification competition. The dataset consists of various medical images of the lower lumbar spine (external data). Each image is given 5 key points that correspond to the 5 lower lumbar vertebrae.

Additionally, we include improved coordinates for the RSNA 2024 data. Here we add coordinates for the left side of each lumbar disc in the sagittal plane. This provides useful orientation information for each disc.

Changelog
V1. Added external coordinate data
V2. Added improved RSNA coordinates
